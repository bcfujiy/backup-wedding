## Exploring Tuscany
We hope you’ll get to experience Tuscany (and Italy) while you’re here - whether together with us or on your own. In the region, we’ve enjoyed exploring small towns, visiting markets and castles, and of course eating our way across the countryside. 

There are lots of places to visit nearby; including 7 UNESCO World Heritage Sites within 60 to 90 minutes by car or train. Tuscany is the region with the largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Properties in the world. Our host Francesco’s favorite excursions are Florence, Siena, Cortona, Chianti area with wine tasting, Pisa, Lucca, San Gimignano, Monteriggioni, Montalcino with Brunello wine tasting (full day), Pienza, Assisi, Perugia. Check out Francesco’s [list of local things](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GBCjTFTgaoj8sqyeAaR567NjHfuOvzFg/view?usp=sharing)  to do and [other information](https://www.chianti-farm.com/location) about the region and area.

## Private Excursions
Our host Francesco can also arrange some [special private Tuscan experiences](https://www.chianti-farm.com/private_experiences.pdf) to do in the area while we’re there. There’s wine tasting, cooking classes, horseback riding,  truffle hunting -- and lots more. If you’d be interested in any of these experiences, let us know and we can arrange it with Francesco!
