- IMPORTANT: your phone signal may not be strong in the area around the villa. We strongly encourage you to download any information you need to get there so that you have access offline (e.g., download the area map as an offline map in Google Maps)

## Should we rent a car?
There are transportation options (e.g., trains) to Montevarchi, the nearest town, but you may want to rent a car to fully explore the area. There are only a few taxis (4!) in the area. There are some car rentals nearer to the venue, but we recommend you rent the car from the airports in Florence or Rome, to ensure there’s availability. If you’ll be driving, be sure to get a valid [International Driving Permit (IDP)](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html) which is mandatory for you to be able to rent a car in Italy.

## Driving in Italy
See [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x3s7ugy4a8emqg0/eng_laselva_driving_directions.pdf?dl=0) for driving directions to the villa - we recommend you print these out if you’re driving since they're a bit different from what your navigation might provide and in case you can't access them online. In general, we recommend you download maps in Google Maps so you can follow driving directions offline. A lot of the towns have narrow roads, so a smaller car will be the easiest to navigate with. Many major cities, like Florence, may be hard to drive in since they have a lot of one-way roads and entire pedestrian-only areas closed off to driving, so consider taking the train to explore those places. 

## Accommodations
There a lots of different options for accomodations in the area. [Here](https://www.airbnb.com/wishlists/972627988) are a few Airbnbs near the venue. If you prefer a hotel, there is the [Hotel Valdarno](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g488301-d657238-Reviews-Hotel_Valdarno-Montevarchi_Province_of_Arezzo_Tuscany.html) or [Palazzo Mari](https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/palazzo-mari-suite-amp-rooms-b-amp-b.it.html) in Montevarchi.

## Transportation to/from the wedding
If you’re planning to take a taxi to the venue for the wedding, you will need to book your return taxi in advance since there are only 4 taxis available and the taxis typically don’t drive at night. Phone numbers for the taxi drivers are below. Since they speak little English, we recommend sending a message on Whatsapp using basic English to reserve with them:

- NINO:        +39    335398127 
- LUCA:        +39    331    7340000 
- STEFANO:    +39    339    7206702 
- ROBERTO:    +39    3932874498 

## Coronavirus
Since all of the festivities will be outside and all of the guests who are able to get vaccinated will be, many of us won’t be wearing masks, but please do however you feel comfortable! Be sure to check and comply with Covid regulations when you travel. These are changing pretty rapidly. Most international flights may require a negative PCR test before and after your flight. You can check [Italy’s Ministry of Health website](https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioContenutiNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=english&id=5412&area=nuovoCoronavirus&menu=vuoto) for the latest information.

As of September 26th 2021, Italy's latest protocol will be requiring proof of vaccination for the majority of public locations throughout the country. Be sure to bring proof of Italy-approved vaccinations (Comirnaty from Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, Vaxzevria, Jansen/Johnson & Johnson), such as your CDC card or official vaccine record and any other proof). For travellers from the US, along with your vaccine proof, you will need to show a negative result before flying and complete a Passenger Locator Form.

## What about our kiddos?
We love our little friends and everyone is welcome at our wedding. If you haven’t already, let us know who all is coming so we can be sure to account for everyone. If there’s interest, we can also arrange a babysitter to join us at La Selva - let us know if you would want the night off and you’d be interested in that!

## How’s the weather?
Tuscany weather is fairly mild most of the year. At the end of October is just when the weather starts getting a little chilly. Historical average of October says that it can get up to 19 Celsius (66 Fahrenheit) and down to 8 Celsius (46 Fahrenheit). We’ll be celebrating outside into the night, so we recommend folks bring a sweater or jacket for when the sun goes down. 

## What will the program and music be like?
- We’ll be having a relaxed dinner and might skip some of the typical wedding formalities, but we would love for any of our family and friends to make a toast, give a blessing, or say a little something during dinner. Let us know if you’re thinking of saying a few words so we can help the kitchen plan their service
- We love good music and we know you do too. For dinner and dancing after the live music ends, add your favorite tracks to these playlists: [dinner](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/01BFFUNpaBdZXIdgStuZAY?si=7a9dc0fef6f14cb9) (mellow) or [party](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4qPbgXfWLVhQZLr7TZ0SEd?si=90cd1969f2794265) (dancedancedance)

## The day before
On Friday October 29th at 5pm, for anyone around, join us at the villa for a relaxed grill. We'll have some options, but feel free to bring something to throw on the grill if you'd like - Brian will be trying his hand at Tuscany's Bistecca alla Fiorentina.

## The day after
On Sunday October 31st at noon, join us at the villa for a casual Masquerade Pizza Party! We’ll be serving up typical Italian pizzas cooked on the spot in a wood pizza oven by the pool. You can choose whatever your heart desires: Margherita, Napoli, Quattro formaggi, Tartufi, Speck and gorgonzola, you get the idea. It's Halloween, so feel free to wear an [Italian masquerade mask](https://www.explore-italian-culture.com/italian-masquerade-masks.html), a costume, or whatever you want!

## What if I have food allergies?
We are so excited to eat amazing, fresh Italian food with you all weekend! As much as possible, we encourage you to be flexible with your preferences and try the local food while you’re there (you won’t be disappointed!). If you do have an allergy, let us know ASAP so we can be sure to accommodate you.

## Gifts?
We know it’s not easy to travel across the world to celebrate our wedding, especially this year, so your presence is plenty.
